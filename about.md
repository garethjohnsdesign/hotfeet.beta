We work across borders and cultural divides creating long and short form content for online platforms, broadcast and cinematic release. 

We take time to find and create the most impactful, hard hitting, thoughtful and beautiful stories. 

We work as a collective, celebrating talent, women filmmakers and broad experiences across sectors. We work with individuals and teams who demonstrate a breadth of skills and experiences. 

When building teams to assign to projects we seek out collaborators from, the third sector, journalism, filmmaking, the arts, designers, writers, charities and social entrepreneurs who can bring depth, experience and genuine understanding and empathy to the work we create and publish. 

Hot Feet was founded by Director Henrietta Norton and Photographer/DOP Daniel Dennison in 2015 in London. With offices in London and Dublin we work with International partners and platforms. 

Hot Feet's first feature film was nominated for multiple awards at festivals across Ireland, The UK, The Middle East and America, including Best Human Rights Film at Galway Film Fleadh and Best Documentary at The London Irish Film Festival in 2016.
